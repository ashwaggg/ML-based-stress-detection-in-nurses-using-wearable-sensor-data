This project uses a publicly available dataset collected from nurses during actual hospital shifts using the Empatica E4 wearable device. The dataset includes:

- Electrodermal Activity (EDA)
- Heart Rate (HR)
- Skin Temperature (TEMP)
- 3-axis Acceleration (X, Y, Z)
- Stress level labels (Low, Medium, High)

**Kaggle Source:**  
The dataset can be accessed directly from Kaggle at:
